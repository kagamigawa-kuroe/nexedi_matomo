# application matomo

`Matomo` is a free and open source software web analytics application developed by a team of international developers, that runs on a `PHP/MySQL `webserver. It tracks online visits to one or more websites and displays reports on these visits for analysis.

Now I create a automatic deployment script with the framework of `slapos.buildout` (python), to depoly it on the server in operating system `slapos`
