# How To Add a Matomo Backup Function

---

In the previous two steps, we have completed the download of the matomo source file and the addition of the instance configuration file. Now, we can make a series of configurations for the matomo application. Let's start by adding a backup feature to matomo.

### operation

---

> 1. To create a bash script in instance, we need to provide a template script file. So create a new file named **`matomo-backup.sh.in`** in folder **`matomo`**
>
> 2. Add necessary dependencies in file **`software.cfg`**
>    - Add a new line **`../../component/diffutils/buildout.cfg`** in variable **`extends`** of section **`buildout`**, it will download the componant **`diff`**, who will be used in bash script to check if the contents of two files are the same
>    - In variable **`context`** of section **`template-matomo-instance`**, add some keyword who will be passed to script by instance configurantion file we added before( that means those keyword will be passed to file **`matomo-instance.cfg`** firstly, and then in **`matomo-instance.cfg`** they will be repassed to the script ), like location of php bin file, like the directory of some componants who will be used.
>    - Create a new section named **`template-matomo-backup.sh `**, it will extend the download base section we added before and read the corresponding template file name in **`buildout.hash.cfg`**, then help us download the template script file we added.
>
> 3. Then, to create script file in instance, we need to edit something in **`matomo-instance.cfg.in`**:
>
>    - Add a new section **`instancd ~/srv/project/slapos/software/matoce-parameter`**, where we accept parameters passed by **`software.cfg`**, and also who will be used by the script.
>
>    - In section **`php-bin`**, we use a function **wrapper** to wrapper the php bin command, when we need to run php bin file, we could use it like this:
>
>      ```
>      {{ php_bin }}:wrapper-path
>      ```
>
>    - In order to generate the script file in the instance, we need a section **`matomo-backup.sh`**, in variable **`rendered`**, use **`${directory:scripts}`** as the directory of script (this keyword is defined in **LAMP**), pass the parameters in section **`instance-parameter`** and the php-bin running command to it
>
> 4. Same as file **matomo-instance.cfg.in** ,we also need to register the script file in **`buildout.hash.cfg`**:
>
>    ```
>    [template-matomo-backup.sh]
>    filename = matomo-backup.sh.in
>    md5sum =
>    ```
>
> 5. Finally, add a new variable **`part-list`** in section **`custom-application-deployment`** of file **`software.cfg`**, this step will let the bash file be readed by **LAMP** so it can work normally.



### check

---

Recompile it like what we did before

```
cd ~/srv/project/slapos/software/matomo
../../update-hash
slapos node software --all
slapos node instance --all
```

Normally, now you can find corresponding output bash script file in directory **`~/srv/runner/instance/slapnodeX/etc/run`** (X is the number of slappart where your instance is), and we can find the parameter in the script has been replaced by its value
