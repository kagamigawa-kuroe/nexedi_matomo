# How To Add Regular Backup Function

---

We can now start using matomo, but please wait a minute, before we start, there is still one step we need to do, we want the backup fonction we write before to be execute regularly, that means we want to make a daily or weekly backup of the matomo configuration file.

This step is quitely simple, we just need to make a little change on the previous code

### operation

>1. We add a cron section in file **`matomo-instance.cfg.in`**, using a function **`cron.d`** in cookbookï¼Œ this function can set a cron task, **`frequency`** is the frequency of task execution( The five parameters represent minutes, hours, the day of the month, the month, and the day of the week ) and **`comand`** is used to refer the command we want to execute, here is the bash script of backup.
>
>   ```
>   [matomo-backup-cron]
>   recipe = slapos.cookbook:cron.d
>   cron-entries = ${cron:cron-entries}
>   name = matomo-backup
>   frequency = 0 0 * * *
>   command = ${matomo-backup.sh:rendered}
>   ```
>
>2. Add "`matomo-backup-cron`" into variable "`part-list`" like we did before
>

>That's all

### Check

>Recompile it, then check if there exist a file named **`matomo-backup`** in path **`~/srv/project/runnner/slappart2/etc/cron.d/`**, if it exist, congratulations, we have completed all the configuration of matomo, then, we can start using it
